# Animal shelter
***Project topic and problem statement***

Project is helping people getting easier access to shelters. Main goal is to attract possible adopters or donations that would help shelter.

Sarajevo, capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina has big problem with stray dogs. Last year there were 11 000 stray dogs on the streets of Sarajevo. All effort of animal volunteers and donations from non-profitable organizations such as Av Mau or even free sterilizations of dogs, founded by Dog Trust - organization from UK, didnâ€™t help in solving the problem. Animal lovers are putting their effort in solving a problem, and this web page will make that easier. There is option to see the list of dogs, and adopt, but it also helps in case people want to help in some other way, like donating, fostering and volunteering. Web page also has place for Adds which will help in earning money, besides getting donations.

***Targeted audience*** are people who want to help stray animals, usually animal lovers, of all age and genders. All ***devices*** are supported.
The element where I put the most effort is filtering DOM elements according to given condition.

***Problem*** that need to be solved, during next phase are login and registering, and connecting logged accounts with adopted dogs.
