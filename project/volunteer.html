			<h2>Volunteer</h2>
			
			<p>Volunteers serve  in important roles at our shelters, in the community, and in their own homes. Find an opportunity that's right for you! </p>

			<p><b>Adoption Support</b>
			Volunteers working in adoption support provide two important roles in helping to fulfill our mission. The first is customer assistance on the adoption floor, answering questions from visitors and facilitating visitations. The second is animal socialization that helps keep our animals happy, healthy and adoptable. Check for current availability.</p>

			<p><b>Dog Walker</b>
			Volunteers provide dogs waiting for adoption with needed exercise and socialization.</p>

			<p><b>Surgical Prep Assistant</b>
			Volunteers working in the surgery department provide support to the Veterinarians and Veterinary Technicians in order to efficiently spay/neuter the thousands of animals who are surrendered to us each year. </p>

			<p><b>Puppy Bather</b>
			Volunteers help groom and bathe dogs available for adoption to help keep them healthy and in good appearance for potential adopters. This is an add-on, on-call role for active volunteers.</p>
