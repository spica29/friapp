			<div class="story">
				<p>If you remember on Saturday I shared the post about this pup who was relinquished by his owner and the pup was so distraught at the shelter he was shutting down. For 8+ hrs we all frantically tried to share as much as possible hoping to save Taz. The video was seen 2.2million times and through the thread, an angel (Luis Galvan) went into action and parked himself outside the shelter for 6 hrs until it opened and he was able to adopt Taz. Today his new owner posted a photo and I think it's safe to say, Taz is in a loving home and being spoiled as he deserves. Miracles can happen through social media!</p>
